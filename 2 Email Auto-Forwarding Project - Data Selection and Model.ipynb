    "- In my own experience, spending time re-routing emails to the correct person is not only mindless and time-consuming for the person forwarding the emails, but also increases the time it takes for the correct person to receive the email. It also increases the probability that emails will get missed and requests are over-looked.\n",
    "- In this project I aim to build a program that takes emails as inputs direclty from an outlook application and forwards them to the appropriate person based on past forwarding behaviour.\n",
    "- To do this, I use Natural Language Processing to convert the text into a bag of words and train a neural network model to classify the emails.\n",
    "- To simulate a real-world situation and avoid using personal data, I am using emails forwarded by one employee with the enron email dataset, a public dataset of 500,000 emails.\n",
    "- I use 2019 code from kaggle user DFOLY1 to pre-process the enron email data set. Accessed from: \"https://www.kaggle.com/code/dfoly1/k-means-clustering-from-scratch\".\n",
    "- The model is based on a chat-bot model used in a 2020 video by NeuralNine which can be found here: \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lwddP0KUEg\"."

My comment would be to \\nadd a clause saying that MPC would have x (5?) many days to respond to ENA \\nonce notified that the turbine is again available for sale.\\n\\nChris\\n\\n4.   If during the Term, MPC determines it does not desire to proceed with\\nthe purchase of the Turbine, MPC shall promptly notify ENA in writing, and\\nthis Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the earlier of the date of\\nENA's receipt of such notice or the expiration of the Term, without any\\nfurther liability of either Party to the other hereunder.  If, during the\\nTerm, ENA determines in good faith that it is unable to negotiate for the\\nsale of the Turbine due to circumstances relating to the generator, it shall\\nnotify MPC and refund the Consideration; provided, however, that if ENA\\noffers the Turbine for sale within 14 days of the termination in connection \\nwith the foregoing, then MPC shall be entitled to an additional exclusivity \\nperiod of 10  business days to negotiate a definitive agreement in accordance \\nwith the terms of this agreement.
